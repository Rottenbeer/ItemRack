* Fixed item swap failure during casting
Attempting to item swap during casting will now wait for an end-combat, or cancel-casting event before swapping instead of failing.
A known bug is it won't finish the swap if you complete a cast but do not enter combat (e.g. autoqueue item comes off cd while you are mounting)

Thanks to blastehh!

__ New in 3.42 - By Rottenbeer __
* Fix for alt+click queue toggle
Auto queue wasn't working due to mismatching usage of 'true' and '1'

Thanks to blastehh!
__ New in 3.41 - By Rottenbeer __
* Fix individual slot queue toggle
The addon currently tries to queue all slots and ignores the checkbox "Auto queue this slot"
This will make it check the table to see if the box was actually ticked before queuing a slot.

* Created new consolidated patterns for ItemLink/ItemString-to-ItemRackStyleID, ItemRackStyleID-to-BaseID, ItemLink/ItemString-to-BaseID
* Created new functions that use those patterns, and various other new helper functions, in order to consolidate all ItemString-handling in one place
* Replaced all old-style handling of itemIDs (string.gsub/find/match) and made everything use the new functions instead, for more robust handling as well as easy updates in the future
* Replaced GUI drawing code with references to new functions, to get icons and tooltips to work in the GUI
* Updated the GUI code so that it always draws item tooltips using the player's current level, which ensures that mousing over heirlooms in saved sets will actually show their stats for your CURRENT level (the old code set all levels to 0 which made it so the stats were shown incorrectly as level 1)
* Improved the two functions that actually LOCATE the stored equipment set items inside the player's inventory/equipment/bank (whether it's for equipping, or simply displaying a tooltip), by making sure those functions pass the INCOMING ID through the new level updater (UpdateIRString) to ensure all old Item IDs are up to date, thus fixing the bug where leveling up would cause ItemRack to fail strict item search on all saved sets and resort to any-item-with-the-same-baseID; this injection point was chosen because it fixes the problem completely throughout the board, since everything that locates items relies on the item finding functions
* Updated the functions for getting info for an item (GetInfoByID), posting an itemlink to the chatbox when shift clicking an item in ItemRack's GUI (ChatLinkID), and the function for showing an item in a tooltip, so that they all pass the incoming ID through the level updater (UpdateIRString) in order to work with up-to-date information, since it's important that stats are correct whether it's for posting chat links or looking at a tooltip's stats
* Commented and cleaned up terrible code here and there, as I untangled the messy code (minor changes)
